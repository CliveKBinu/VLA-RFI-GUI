Testing with the wrapper
===========

Run this from anywhere

``/home/sandboxes/kpurcell/repos/RFI_GUI/gbt_rfi_gui_wrapper``

Email kpurcell@nrao.edu If any changes need to be made.

This wrapper will run the same way and point to the same location as the wrapper will when it is released to production. The wrapper is in my sandbox but it is referencing and environment in a staged production- ready area. Use the program as you would in production
